# Red Beard LLC Corporate Landing Page

Corporate website for **Red Beard LLC**, a Montana-based company operating media, software, ecommerce, and digital product businesses.

Canonical public domain: **https://Red-Beard.com**

Public contact email: **info@red-beard.com**

Public mailing address:

1106 W. Park Street Suite 20 # 142  
Livingston, MT 59047

## Project Purpose

This site is intentionally small. It serves as:

- the public corporate home for Red Beard LLC;
- proof of legitimacy for customers, partners, payment providers, OAuth providers, and other services;
- the canonical parent-company identity for approved Red Beard LLC products and brands;
- a stable location for company contact and legal information.

It is not intended to be a large marketing site or creator landing page.

## Approved V1 Public Brands / Projects

- The Den of Tools
- 3D Print Rancher
- Print Ranch Manager

Do not add experimental, private, unreleased, or other Red Beard LLC projects unless Jeff explicitly approves them for public listing.

## Hosting and Infrastructure

Preferred hosting: **GitHub Pages**

Requirements:

- $0/month hosting
- static site only
- custom domain support
- HTTPS
- no database
- no CMS
- no WordPress
- no unnecessary JavaScript frameworks
- no analytics or tracking by default
- easy for Codex to maintain directly through GitHub
- DNS may remain managed by the current registrar and point to GitHub Pages

## V1 Site Architecture

Keep the implementation intentionally small:

```text
/
├── index.html
├── privacy.html
├── terms.html
├── accessibility.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── assets/
│   └── ...
├── CNAME
└── README.md
```

A separate Brands page is not required for V1. Approved brands can be presented cleanly on the home page.

### Home Page

Include:

- Red Beard LLC corporate identity
- concise positioning statement: a Montana-based media, software, ecommerce, and digital products company
- brief About section
- approved public brands/projects
- public contact and business information
- links to legal/trust pages
- copyright notice

### Legal / Trust

Include:

- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Use
- Accessibility Statement
- Contact information
- Copyright notice

Add an affiliate disclosure only if the Red Beard LLC corporate site itself contains affiliate links.

Do not add GDPR, CCPA, cookie-consent, or similar compliance UI unless the site's actual behavior or legal requirements make it necessary.

## Design Direction

The site should feel:

- professional
- understated
- trustworthy
- modern
- Montana-based without cowboy clichés
- more like a small holding/operating company than a creator landing page

Avoid:

- fake corporate stock-photo aesthetics
- excessive animation
- overly AI-looking design
- startup jargon
- unnecessary sections

### Identity / Logo

An official Red Beard LLC logo is being completed and will be supplied later.

The logo is **not a blocker** for initial implementation. Until the approved logo is available, use a restrained text-based **Red Beard LLC** identity that can be replaced cleanly without redesigning the site.

## Technical Standards

- semantic HTML5
- responsive CSS
- keyboard accessibility
- visible focus states
- proper labels and document landmarks
- reasonable WCAG 2.2 AA practices
- sufficient text/background contrast
- minimal or zero JavaScript unless a concrete requirement emerges
- no tracking scripts by default
- no third-party dependencies unless justified
- fast loading and easy maintenance
- sensible title, description, canonical, Open Graph, and other basic metadata

## Development Roles

**JEFF** — Product Owner  
Approves public identity, content, brands, major scope decisions, and production launch.

**CHATGPT** — Senior Product Architect / Project Manager  
Defines architecture and requirements, reviews Codex work, manages scope and project handshake, and hands implementation tasks to Codex.

**CODEX** — Implementation Engineer  
Implements approved work in the repository, tests it, documents completed actions, and returns ownership through the handshake.

## AI PROJECT HANDSHAKE

**Protocol Version:** 1.0  
**Handshake:** H-0002  
**Current Owner:** CODEX  
**State:** READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION  
**Task ID:** RBLP-001  

**Last Completed Action:**  
Jeff confirmed the canonical domain Red-Beard.com, public contact email info@red-beard.com, creation of the RedBeardLLC Codex project and GitHub repository, and authorized implementation. ChatGPT established the authoritative project charter, V1 scope, architecture, design direction, and technical requirements in README.md.

**Next Required Action:**  
Codex must synchronize with the current repository, read this README in full, verify H-0002 is the authoritative handshake, and implement the complete V1 static site according to this charter. Initial implementation should include index.html, privacy.html, terms.html, accessibility.html, css/styles.css, CNAME configured for Red-Beard.com, and only necessary local assets. Use a restrained text-based Red Beard LLC identity until Jeff provides the approved logo. Do not add analytics, tracking, a CMS, framework dependencies, cookie banners, or unapproved brands. After implementation, validate internal links, responsive behavior, keyboard usability, basic WCAG-oriented accessibility, and static-site operation. Commit and push the work, then update this handshake with the new handshake number, set Current Owner to CHATGPT, summarize the implementation and verification performed, and identify any blockers or items requiring Jeff's approval.

**Blockers:**  
None for initial implementation. Official Red Beard LLC logo is pending but is explicitly non-blocking.

## Handshake Rules

README.md is the single source of truth for project state.

Whenever ChatGPT or Codex begins or resumes work:

1. Read the latest committed README.md.
2. Read the AI PROJECT HANDSHAKE section first.
3. Identify Protocol Version, Handshake, Current Owner, State, Task ID, Last Completed Action, Next Required Action, and Blockers.
4. Compare the repository handshake with any previously known state.
5. Discard stale remembered state whenever the repository is newer.
6. Do not perform implementation work unless the handshake assigns ownership appropriately.
7. The party completing its assigned task must update the handshake before handing ownership to the next party.

Conversation history and memory are subordinate to the current committed README.md.
